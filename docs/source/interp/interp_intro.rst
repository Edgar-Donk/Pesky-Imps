Introduction Interpolation
==========================

Given a set of points it often is useful to find the values in between, or
create a curve that joins the points sequentially. Interpolation does not
require that the underlying function is found, in fact there may be no
known mathematical equation to describe the process. The starting method is
simply joining the points with a straight line, provided the points are 
already near enough in a straight line this may suffice. As the intervals 
become smaller this becomes a better approximation.
