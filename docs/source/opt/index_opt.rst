
Optimisation
============

Finding extrema (maxima and minima) show the local peaks and troughs
of the function. In many applications these are used to find an optimum
solution to a problem, that if undertaken mathematically involve the
derivative and the second derivative(differentials). The extrema can be found 
by a variety of means similar to the manner in which the root of an equation
was found, but the method of testing will differ.
